# Python_labs
## Objective

This lab showcases the practical Python skills I developed during my cybersecurity program. I used Python to write scripts for automating tasks, analyzing logs, and supporting incident response, building a strong technical foundation for real- world cybersecurity work.

### Skills Learned

- I learned how to write Python scripts to automate repetitive security tasks, saving time and reducing human error.
- I became comfortable analyzing log files using Python to spot unusual patterns or signs of suspicious activity.
- I explored how authomation can make cybersecurity processes faster and more reliable, like scanning files or checking IP addresses.
- I learned to handle errors gracfully in my code, making it more stable and user-friendly.
- I worked with useful Python libraries like os, re, and applied them to real-life cybersecurity problems.
- I strengthened my understanding of loops, if -else statements, and other logic tools to build functional security scripts.
- This experience boosted my confidence in using programmimg as of my technical skillset and deepened my passion for security.

### Tools Used

- I used Python as my main scripting language to automate tasks and analyze data.
- With Jupyter Notebook, I wrote and tested my code interactively, which helped me uderstand each step clearly.
- For hands-on security learning, I used platforms like wireshark to better understand network behaviour.
- I practiced analyzing logs and identifying threats using actual log files provided in labs.
- Using requests and json, I practiced pulling data from APIs and analyzing structured information.
